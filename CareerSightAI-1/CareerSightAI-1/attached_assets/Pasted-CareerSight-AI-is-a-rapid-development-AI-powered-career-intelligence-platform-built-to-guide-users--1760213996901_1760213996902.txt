CareerSight AI is a rapid-development, AI-powered career intelligence platform built to guide users from profile creation through personalized job recommendations, learning roadmaps, and market insights—all in under six hours. Leveraging Google Gemini’s advanced generative AI, it transforms raw job-market data into actionable career strategies.

At its core, CareerSight AI ingests real-time job postings (e.g., Naukri.com’s November 2024 dataset), normalizes key fields (titles, companies, locations, salary, experience, skills), and builds a semantic skill-job matrix via TF-IDF and cosine similarity. Users begin by entering their skills, experience level, interests, and location preferences. The system then:

Intelligent Career Matching

Scores and ranks jobs based on deep semantic matching of user skills to job requirements.

Applies location, salary, and experience filters to refine suggestions.

Personalized Learning Roadmaps

Detects each user’s skill gaps and, using Google Gemini, auto-generates a detailed three-month roadmap with weekly milestones, curated resources, and project suggestions.

Skills Gap Analysis

Compares user skills against market requirements, prioritizes missing competencies, and highlights the highest-impact skills to learn.

Real-Time Market Intelligence

Continuously analyzes job posting trends to surface in-demand skills, top hiring companies, salary benchmarks, and geographic hot spots.

Generates visual dashboards—bar charts for top skills, pie charts for locations, line graphs for salary trends—to make insights digestible.

Interactive AI Guidance

Provides conversational career coaching (interview tips, resume advice, networking strategies) through Gemini’s natural language interface.

Built on an IBM LinuxONE instance with Jupyter Lab and Streamlit, CareerSight AI emphasizes modular, cache-optimized components for sub-500 ms response times. Its mobile-responsive design and accessible web interface ensure broad usability. Risk mitigation includes mock data fallbacks, pre-captured screenshots, and video backups for seamless demos.

Within six hours, the platform delivers a polished, end-to-end experience: from entering a few profile details to exploring tailored job matches, following a dynamic learning plan, and understanding real-world market dynamics—all powered by Google Gemini’s multimodal AI capabilities.
